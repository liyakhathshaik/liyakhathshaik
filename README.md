# üëã About Me

Unlike most, I don‚Äôt build random projects just to fill a portfolio ‚Äî I start with **real-world problems**, and then engineer solutions with purpose.

I‚Äôm a Computer Science and Engineering student specializing in **Artificial Intelligence**, with a passion for **astronomy**, **robotics**, and **space exploration**. I have a desire to solve meaningful challenges through innovative AI and technology. I always ensure that my projects **address real, impactful issues**.

Each repository you find here is more than just code ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **mission to solve**, a **concept engineered from scratch**, and a **step toward a smarter future**.

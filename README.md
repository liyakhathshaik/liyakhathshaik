# 👋 About Me
Hey there! I'm a Computer Science & Engineering student, diving deep into Artificial Intelligence with a big curiosity for medicine,biology, astronomy and robotics,.

 I care more about exploring real-world problems and trying to understand them from different angles. My projects just my way of thinking through challenges and seeing how tech (especially AI) can help.

What you’ll find here , it’s me experimenting, learning, and doing my part to contribute to a smarter, kinder future in my own way. Just honest curiosity and a little ambition to make things better.
